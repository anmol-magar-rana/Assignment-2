I was completely new to javascript coming into this assignment, apart from what was taught in tutorials. All the syntax was new and confusing to me, and I spent a significant amount of time watching tutorials on YouTube on how things work. Figuring it would be better to have a more hands-on approach, I did a mini coding project following a tutorial on tictactoe on YouTube. I still struggled with the coding of the functionalities of the game but at least I was more familiar with the syntax and what was happening. Using the console on the webpage using F12 and using console.log() was a big part of the process for me in trying to fix bugs and figure out why the program was behaving the way it did. I did seek help from AI but even with their explanation, it took me a long time before I could use their code. Before javascript everything was hardcoded, including the initial positions of the images of the chess pieces but now I'm using javascript for that and have managed to add some other functionalities to the game, albeit it is not perfect. My only regret is that I overestimated my abilities and should have placed this assignment on a higher priority given my lack of understanding of javascript. But even with the submission over, I plan to continue working on it and perfecting it overtime.
